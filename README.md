"E-commerce Sales Analysis" is a data analytic project conducted in Python using Machine Learning, sklearn library. We have used data from historical Olympic games. We have predicted how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

## Tools and Technologies Used

**Sklearn:** It is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.  

**Pandas:** It is a widely used open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

**Numpy:** It is a fundamental Python library for numerical computing.
## Project Steps

1. Form a hypothesis.

2. Find and explore the data.

3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.

4. Clean the data for ML.

5. Pick an error metric.

6. Split your data.

7. Train a model.
